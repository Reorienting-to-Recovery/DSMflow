\description{
A named list containing datasets with the flow within the bypasses for
estimating available rearing habitat within the bypasses. The components of the list contain output from
four different Calsim runs:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: output from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: output from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item calsim_run_of_river: output from the Calsim Run of River run.
\item LTO-12a: output from the LTO-12a Calsim III run.
}
}
\details{
The flow in cubic feet per second through the bypasses are represented using
'FLOW-CHANNEL' and 'FLOW-DELIVERY' nodes from CALSIM II.
The nodes for each watershed are outlined above.

\section{Model Usage}{

The habitat within the bypasses are split at the major weirs.
