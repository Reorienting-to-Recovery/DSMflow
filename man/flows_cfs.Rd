\description{
A named list containing datasets from the 2008-2009, 2018-2019 BiOp, and Calsim Run of River Calsim II runs and
the LTO-12a Calsim III runs for use with the CVPIA SIT Salmon Population Model to develop habitat inputs. This data object
also contains synthetic hydrographs for functional flows designed to optimize salmonid survival.
The named list components are:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: flow in cubic feet per second within watersheds from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: flow in cubic feet per second within watersheds from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item calsim_run_of_river: flow in cubic feet per second within watersheds from the Calsim Run of River run.
\item eff: flow in cubic feet per second within watersheds with a synthetic hydrograph for the Upper Sacramento River and San Joaquin River
\item LTO_12a: flow in cubic feet per second within watersheds from the Calsim III LTO-12a run.
\item LTO_12a_eff_dy: flow in cubic feet per second within watersheds from the Calsim III LTO-12a run, with the functional flow
synthetic hydrograph spliced in for model dry years.
}
}
\details{
The flow is represented using 'FLOW-CHANNEL' and 'FLOW-DELIVERY' nodes from CALSIM II.
The nodes and calculation for each watershed are outlined above.

The Sutter and Yolo Bypasses' flows are stored in a separate dataset
\code{\link{bypass_flows}} to enable the habitat segmentation in the bypasses
according to weir locations.

The Lower-mid Sacramento River has two nodes, one above Fremont Weir (C134) and one below (C160).
When calculating habitat for the Lower-Mid Sacramento river, calculate the habitat at each flow node and
sum them proportion to the length of stream above and below the weir:
\deqn{35.6/58 * (habitat at C134) + 22.4/58 * (habitat at C160)}

\emph{*Because there are no modeled flows at Bear Creek, flows at Paynes Creek are used}

\emph{**Mokelumne River flow is from a separate model provided by EBMUD.}
