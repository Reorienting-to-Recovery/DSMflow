\description{
A named list with datasets containing the inflow, total diversions, and proportion
diverted for the North and South Deltas from three different Calsim  runs. The components of the list contain output from
four different Calsim runs:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: output from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: output from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item calsim_run_of_river: output from the Calsim Run of River run.
\item LTO-12a: output from the LTO-12a Calsim III run.
}
}
\details{
The inflow, diversions, and proportions diverted in the North and South
Deltas are represented using 'FLOW-CHANNEL' and 'FLOW-DELIVERY' nodes from CALSIM II.

The North Delta is defined as the area west of and including the Sacramento River
below Freeport to Chips Island.

The South Delta is defined as the area east of the Sacramento River below Freeport
to Chips Island and the San Joaquin River below Vernalis. The nodes and calculation
for each delta are outlined above.
