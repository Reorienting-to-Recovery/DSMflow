\format{
a named list where each component is a 31 by 12 matrix (watersheds by months)
}
\usage{
proportion_pulse_flows
}
\description{
A named list with estimated monthly proportion of flow that is a pulse. The components of the list contain output from
four different Calsim runs:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: output from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: output from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item calsim_run_of_river: output from the Calsim Run of River run.
\item LTO-12a: output from the LTO-12a Calsim III run.
}
}
\details{
proportion_pulse_flows = sd(flow)/median(flow)/100

The value is divided by 100 to adjust the scaling to more closely resemble measured data.

Calculated using \code{\link{flows_cfs}}
