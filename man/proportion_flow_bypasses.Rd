\title{Proportion of Sacramento River Flow through the Sutter and Yolo Bypasses}
\format{
a named list where each element contains a 12 by 21 by 2 array (month, year, bypass):

\link{ , , 1} = Sutter Bypass represented with CALSIM II nodes (D117 + D124 + D125 + D126)/C116

\link{ , , 2} = Yolo Bypass represented with CALSIM II nodes D160/C134

\description{
The monthly proportion of Sacramento River flow within the bypasses
(years 1980-2000) for use with the CVPIA SIT Salmon Population Model to
apportion fish onto the bypasses. The components of the list contain output from
four different Calsim runs:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: output from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: output from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item calsim_run_of_river: output from the Calsim Run of River run.
\item LTO-12a: output from the LTO-12a Calsim III run.
}
}
\details{
The proportions of Sacramento River flowing through the bypasses are represented using
'FLOW-CHANNEL' and 'FLOW-DELIVERY' nodes from CALSIM II.

Some of the calculated values for Yolo Bypass were greater than 1.
These values were capped at 1 for model usage.
