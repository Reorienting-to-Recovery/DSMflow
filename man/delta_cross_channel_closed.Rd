\description{
The number of days and proportion of days the Delta Cross Channel
gates are typically closed for each month. The components of the list contain output from
four different Calsim runs:
\itemize{
\item biop_2008_2009: output from the 2008-2009 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item biop_itp_2018_2019: output from the 2018-2019 Calsim II BiOp run.
\item calsim_run_of_river: output from the Calsim Run of River run.
\item LTO-12a: output from the LTO-12a Calsim III run.
}
}
\details{
By rule, 45 days between November-January, based on real time monitoring.
For modeling purposes, the days closed where divided between December and January.

Note: Some real-time changes possible based on:
\itemize{
\item fish monitoring
\item interior delta salinity
\item flood operations
}

In May, typically open for Memorial Day.
